                At Haci Beach, we know that good food and drink are just as essential to a great vacation as stunning
                scenery and sunny beaches. That's why our restaurant and bar are the perfect place to refuel and
                recharge during your stay.

                    <p>
                        For those who like to keep things simple, our little market has everything you need to stock up
                        for
                        a
                        day of hiking or camping. With fresh fruits and vegetables straight from the farmers of the
                        local
                        village, you can be sure you're fueling your body with the best.

                    <p>
                        And for those who prefer a bit more variety, our restaurant offers delicious options all day
                        long.
                        Start your day with a typical Turkish breakfast featuring omelettes or a refreshing smoothie
                        bowl.
                        As
                        you soak up the sun on the beach, enjoy a fresh sandwich or a crisp salad from our lunch menu.
                        And
                        when
                        evening rolls around, indulge in the catch of the day paired perfectly with a glass of raki.

                        daiquiris during happy hour, our cocktails are the perfect accompaniment to a stunning sunset.
                        And
                        for
                        those who need a little boost in the morning, our freshly brewed coffee is sure to do the trick.
